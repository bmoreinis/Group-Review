Facilitator reads the question aloud.
Facilitator asks for a volunteer to suggest an answer, and explain it: 
Volunteer answerer/explainer explains. 
If nobody volunteers, the facilitator suggests an answer and explains it. 
Facilitator asks the group to vote whether they agree (y or n into chat, don't enter until 1, 2, 3, go!). 
If all agree, proceed to Prep for Return.
If some disagree: 
Call on anyone who entered "n" to explain why and give a different answer.  
If all n responders refuse to justify, the first answer wins. Prep for Return. 
If a second answer is explained:
Facilitator asks each member to say what they think.
After the facilitator decides discussion is over, ask the group to vote on the 1st or 2nd answer. 
Facilitator asks if there is more discussion after the second vote. 
If there is more discussion, talk and vote as required. 
If not, the group will move forward with the last vote's majority decision.
